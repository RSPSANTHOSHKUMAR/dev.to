<h2>Main Typography</h2>
<p>
Default font is set to 16px (fs-base). It should be standard in UI.
Smaller and bigger font sizes should be used carefully with respect to
good visual rythm between elements.
</p>
<p>
XS size should be used as little as possible in edge cases. Even though
it’s readable we could consider it not meeting DEV’s standards. So keep it
for like “asterisk copy” etc.
</p>
<p>By default you should be using Regular font weight.</p>
<p>
Medium should be used to emphasize something but not make it as loud as
Bold.
</p>
<p>Heavy should be used only for bigger title.</p>
